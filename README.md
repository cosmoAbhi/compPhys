Codes developed in the course of the Computational Physics course (P452):

1. Ising_Abhishek.cpp is a code to evolve a 2D Ising chain using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
2. Ising_thermalization is an extension of the above to compute the energy and magnetization at different temperatures to find the transition temperature.
